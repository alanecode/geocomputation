# gsa2017

This repository was born as a stripped-down fork of the King's Geocomputation [repository](https://github.com/kingsgeocomp/geocomputation). Its purpose it to keep track of changes to the `.yml` file used for setting up a [conda](https://conda.io/docs/) environment which turnecd out to be necessary during Spatial Analysis tutorials in Spring 2018. It should provide a place where an up-to-date working version of the environment can be retrieved and installed from, via:

```
conda env create -f <fname>
```
